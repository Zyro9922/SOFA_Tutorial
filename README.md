# Boost C++ AstroPy + SOFA

This project aims at demonstrating how we can use SOFA to implement algorithms required to perform coordinate, reference frame conversion and various other astronomical calculations.

### SOFA
SOFA stands for Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy. The SOFA software is a collection of
Fortran 77 and ANSI C subprograms that implement official IAU algorithms for fundamentalastronomy computations.

### Background / Terminologies
1. [Coordinates Subpackage Plan](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/master/APE5.rst) 
    This official document of AstroPy clearly defines each and every term such as Coordinate Representation, Reference System, Coordinate etc.
2. [NPTEL Course Civil Engineering Higher Surveying by Dr. Ajay Dashora](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/105103176/)
    The Astronomy part of this lecture covered in Module 2 and Module 3 discusses the fundamentals behind Coordinate System, Reference System etc.
3. [Books I referred](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Bhq7jHb8FMbDa7-H4Bt2HEbcXwpdwLXA)

### AstroPy Official 
1. [AstroPy Documentation](https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/astropy/v1.0.13/astropy.pdf) Explanation on various AstroPy functions and usage.
2. [AstroPy Coordinates](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/) Contains Transformation Graph.

### My conversations

Regarding this project I majorly contacted two person two help me gather right resources. One is the owner of AstroPy Erik Tollerud and Dr. Ajay Dashora Professor at IIT Guwahati.

1. My query to Erik was 
"I want to know the basics and majorly what are reference systems like ICRS, CIRS, Helio Centric, etc. How are they related to coordinate systems like Horizon, Equatorial, Galactic, Ecliptic, etc? The mathematics behind transformations among them."
To which he replied [Erik's Reply](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10386jMJCIWm6d4SGzGaHKDBRJL8Bfx7K)
Resource recommended by Erik [The IAU Resolutions on Astronomical Reference Systems, Time Scales, and Earth Rotation Models](https://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/publications/Circular_179.pdf)

2. With Dr. Ajay Dashora. MUST READ
